# House of Pleasures
## Since 1766
Hidden in plain sight at 51 Quai des Augustins, Lapérouse is one of the mythical spots that incarnates a city’s history. The first restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars back in 1933, this special place hasn’t stepped down from center stage – in French haute-gastronomy, and in the social agendas of Parisian elite – ever since. 
For more than two centuries, guests and “cocottes” have flocked to the intimate and discreet ambiance of Lapérouse’s elegant private Salons to share in the magic of a candlelit dinner sublimated by French “joie de vivre”. 
Zola, Maupassant, Baudelaire, Proust… the great Victor Hugo, famous novelist Colette (of “La Chatte”), Serge Gainsbourg (who met Jane Birkin here), Woody Allen (who later chose Lapérouse as the setting for an iconic scene of “Midnight in Paris”), Orson Welles, Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway… if these walls had ears! The literary icons and “men of the world” who have flocked to our famed Salons since 1766 are joined in spirit today by the stars of fashion and cinema, making each memory at Lapérouse an unforgettable moment frozen in time.
“INSIDE THIS INEXTRICABLY ELEGANT, PARISIAN ADDRESS LIES A LOVE STORY WORTHY OF LITERATURE. ITS WALLS OOZE FRENCH SENSUALITY AND PROUSTIAN HERITAGE.”
Cordélia de Castellane, Artistic Director, Baby Dior & Dior Maison.
