## Gigi Circus: The Ultimate Kids’ Club
Because we all know too well that real joy comes from seeing our little ones happy, the Gigi Circus was built to cater to our smallest of friends, who are welcome to join our expert supervisors all day long (from age 5 on if unaccompanied), while the rest of the family enjoys a well-deserved break. On the agenda: bouncy castles, trampolines, ping-pong, water games, and of course (don’t tell mom & dad!) lots of yummy treats.
