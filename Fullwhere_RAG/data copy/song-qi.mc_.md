## DESIGN
To reflect the Chinese gastronomy spirit, a magnificent combination of refined materials has been selected by the architects Humbert & Poyet. With a predominance of black and white, the subtle touches of brass in the lightings, as well as the silky green banquettes and chairs, bring warmth to Song Qi. The softness of velvet counterbalances with the black marble. A tiled star stands out on the floor with its points undulating out across the room in tides of black and white. This intimate restaurant is the perfect association of modernity, luxury and timelessness. All designed by **Humbert & Poyet**.
