## THE ADDRESS
Located in the heart of Paris' Museum of Modern Art, with its outdoor terrace facing the Eiffel Tower and the Seine, Forest - Brasserie Soleil, the latest signature of Chef Julien Sebbag, welcomes Parisians, visitors from all over the world and Les Afficionados d'Art Moderne from Tuesday to Sunday.
A timeless spot, both in winter with its warm, comfortable interior, and in summer with its vast terrace offering one of the finest views of the Eiffel Tower, Forest is a Mediterranean-inspired brasserie, focusing on the finest ingredients. Forest is a Mediterranean-inspired brasserie, with a focus on local and seasonal produce, home-cooked dishes, a selection of refined cocktails and a festive atmosphere in the evening.
## BRASSERIE  SOLEIL
From our selection of crudos to our farm-to-table dishes, not forgetting our range of meats grilled on the Binchotan, the Japanese barbecue that gives them a smoky flavour, the culinary experience is unique and inspiring, in a neo-retro, cosy and relaxed setting.
