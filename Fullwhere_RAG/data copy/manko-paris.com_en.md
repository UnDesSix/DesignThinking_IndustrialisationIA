## MANKO
### PISCO & PERU IN THE CITY
The new MOMA GROUP restaurant opens its doors at 15 avenue Montaigne, in the former Drouot auction house _(where the film Fauteuils d'orchestre was shot)_. Never before has the most beautiful avenue in the Golden Triangle been home to such a predestined and aptly named location...
## LE CHEF MELIO
### the culinary soul of peru even at manko paris
At Manko-PARIS, our gastronomic history is shaped by a passionate, creative and infinitely talented man: Chef Melio. Originally from Peru, he embodies the very essence of our cuisine, bringing the culinary heritage of his native land to every dish he creates.
Chef Melio is much more than a master chef; he's the soul of our restaurant, the driving force behind our iconic Peruvian delights.
## THE MENU ICA
With the ICA menu, the Manko is brightening up the start of the week: ceviche leche de tigre, quinoa burger, seasoning from elsewhere... The menu is shared, to celebrate Peruvian gastronomy and its richness, every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening.

### MANKO-PARIS, A GASTRONOMIC JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF PERU
For centuries, Peruvian cuisine has drawn inspiration from all the world's cultures. Influences from Europe, Japan, China and Africa have fused with ancient Andean culture and the exuberance of the Amazon, giving rise to a unique universe of flavors, revealed and shared today.
Sharing: that's how Peruvian gastronomy is celebrated, and that's how Manko came to Paris.

## LE BAR
### A BAR THAT "WARMS" THE PLANET
As an extension of the restaurant, a cocktail bar allows you to begin or end this sweet journey to Inca lands, with a local touch... by raising the degrees and therefore the temperature! The bar offers all these pleasures in wildly imaginative cocktails, with or without alcohol, with Pisco taking pride of place.

## MANKO LOKO
### MANKO MUSIC
Saxo at the counter, live percussion and good humor. Every Thursday, the Manko Loko has its loyal followers who come back for the art of Pisco, the atmosphere and the exoticism of this unique evening in Paris. A festive, cosmopolitan atmosphere to be found all weekend long in our golden Manko Bar.
