# _THE HISTORY OF HÔTEL BACHAUMONT_
### 20TH CENTURY
Let’s go back in time to the Roaring Twenties in Paris.
The Grand Hôtel de Bachaumont in the heart of Montorgueil was an institution in the French capital.
It takes its name from Louis Petit de Bachaumont, a controversial writer who disclosed sordid secrets about 18th century France in his “Mémoires Secrets”.
### THE HOTEL'S GUESTS BACK IN TIME
The Hôtel Bachaumont was once a coveted destination, drawing an eclectic crowd of notables, doctors, elegant socialites, and writers, all captivated by its prime location just steps from Les Halles and its bustling markets.
In those days, wealthy merchants from the provinces routinely stayed at the Grand Hôtel de Bachaumont. It was here that they conducted their business in a lively atmosphere, often culminating in lavish dinners, occasionally tinged with a hint of excess.
However, with the relocation of France's largest market to Rungis, the vibrant energy surrounding the establishment gradually faded, leaving the hotel to empty over time, a silent witness to a bygone era.
### THE KEY UNDER THE DOOR
The hotel closed its doors, only to be given a new lease on life under the vision of La Clé Group.
A century later, Hôtel Bachaumont rises from its ashes in the most spectacular way! After months of extensive renovations, it has been restored to its former glory: the façade has been meticulously refurbished, unveiling the historic **“Hôtel Bachaumont”** inscription engraved in the stone, while the wrought-iron entrance has been beautifully restored.
The first gem in a collection of elegant and timeless establishments, Hôtel Bachaumont seamlessly blends the charm of its heritage with refined modernity, reaffirming its unique allure in 21st-century Paris.
### SINCE 2015
The establishment has recaptured the spirit and vibrancy of its roaring twenties heyday, with a meticulously restored identity. The hotel, its French restaurant, and its two bars are dedicated to reviving the unique charm and character of its history while seamlessly blending in a contemporary touch.
Designer **Dorothée Meilichzon** has preserved the authenticity of its original architecture, enhancing it with a subtle Art Deco flair that evokes quintessential Parisian elegance.
