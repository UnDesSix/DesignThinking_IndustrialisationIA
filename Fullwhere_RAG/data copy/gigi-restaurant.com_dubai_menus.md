# Menus
## WELCOME TO OUR TABLE
At Gigi Dubai, authentic Italian cuisine comes alive with traditional dishes crafted from fresh, seasonal ingredients. Begin your experience with Arancini Al Tartufo—a delectable bite of truffle-infused arancini that perfectly sets the tone. Whether you’re drawn to the rich flavors of Tonno Rosso or the tender, citrusy Polpo Al Limone, each plate brings a comforting taste of Italy. For dessert, a classic Tiramisu, a Nocciolata Waffle, or a refreshing Gelato Pistacchio awaits, ready to be shared.
