## **BEEFBAR, OUR MEAT RESTAURANT**
### **A one of a kind concept**
Beefbar, a reflection of cosmopolitan culture created by Riccardo Giraudi.
Born in Monte-Carlo in 2005, Beefbar breaks with the rigid, traditional codes of steakhouses, through its glamorous lines, a clear-cut personality, its modern luxury feel and a 360 degrees experience. Every little detail counts. Here, you feel and savor luxury rather than see it, the minute you come through the door.
In the kitchen, our executive chef Thierry Paludetto works closely with Riccardo Giraudi to create incredible, tasty yet simple dishes. Our menu is divided into three parts : sexy street food inspired by the most popular recipes from around the world, great meat cuts sourced in Australia, Japan and the United States, and iconic dishes, from sides to mains and desserts.

## **THE STAR OF THE SHOW**
### **It all started with beef‚Ä¶**
.. in the 2000s, when Riccardo Giraudi joined Giraudi Meats, the family business, and chose to become an importer / exporter of high-end exclusive meats.
Sourcing the finest meats from all over the globe, he quickly became leader in the import of American Black Angus beef such as Creekstone Farms, and first importer of Wagyu and certified Japanese Kobe beef.
Beefbar is the home of these exceptional meat cuts, which are featured on the menu -street food, grilled, BBQs, woks and many more ‚Äì and presented in a top-of-the range butcher shop, built of marble and brass.
As Beefbar isn‚Äôt made only for beef lovers, other options featuring fresh fish and veggies have been created. Picture a zesty Super kale salad with avocado, corn in tempura with spicy mayo or a revamped Hamachi Crudo with freshly grated truffle.

## **HUMBERT & POYET **
### **Tailor made architecture**
The architects Humbert & Poyet define their style as ¬´ warm glamour ¬ª, flamboyant without the stuffiness of the genre. They even say that they have a lot of fun dramatising the idea of luxury, so that it becomes less austere, more fun and accessible.
Just like Riccardo Giraudi, this incredibly creative & visionary duo of architects aims to create an emotion that can be translated into features, volumes, materials and general aesthetics.
These are the reasons why we have been working hand in hand with Humbert & Poyet for the Beefbar brand, for over 15 years now.
In 2021, Humbert & Poyet were named among the 100 best designers by AD Magazine, and received the Label French Design 100 in 2022.

## **BEEFBAR x BERNARDAUD**
### **Art de la table, but fun**
Riccardo Giraudi serves food to his guests in plates he designed himself in collaboration with Bernardaud, the famous Limoges porcelain producer, experienced in the practice of tailor-made items for the most beautiful gastronomic tables.
This collection of fun plates reveals Riccardo Giraudi‚Äôs favorite colorful emojis once the dish is finished. To top it off, Bernardaud gave substance to this idea by affixing them on a delicate white porcelain lined with a gold edging.
