The open air bar with its 360-degree view of Paris, welcomes visitors from Paris and the rest of the world nonstop, from early morning to late night. Destined to become the city’s most coveted summer pop up, Créatures is a special place to kick off, continue or accompany one’s culinary experience. Back for its fourth year at the top of Galeries Lafayette Paris Hausmann, Créatures is now more than ever the place to be during the Parisian summer. Orchestrated by Julien Sebag, the most beautiful rooftop in the capital offers a 100% vegetarian menu for lunch and dinner, the menu is always 100% vegetarian with a focus on local and seasonal Mediterranean cuisine.

## A cool and cosy atmosphere 
At first look, the decor is a “happy mess”, as promised by Uchronia, the architectural firm behind Créatures. Furniture sourced largely from Emmaüs and flea markets featuring recycled materials, and a variety Furniture sourced mainly from Emmaus and flea markets, recycled materials, and a Mediterranean-style pergola that reinforces the beach bar ambiance — with Parisian rooftops playing the role of the big blue.

## A simple yet magical spirit
The “creatures” that fascinate the chef also inspire gourmet, sexy and desirable dishes. A true ode to the moments of life that we take time to enjoy, the rooftop itself is a refuge from the madness of the city, becomes the scene of indulgent sunbathing and lazy evenings with its unobstructed view – like a summer break in the urban jungle. Créatures is not a simple restaurant or bar, but a place to live and share: authentic, joyful, exotic and delicious.

## Créatures Bakery
From 10 am opening, we are intoxicated by the beautiful light sweeping over the iconic Parisian rooftop. Soft yet flaky croissants with sweet delights and brioches fresh out of the oven are a staple for any morning appointment. The mood is simple and magical as always with chef Julien Sebag, who looks to London as inspiration, borrowing from the “bakeries who serve just the essentials with a concerted eye for taste”. This cool and cosy atmosphere is available all day long – like for a well-deserved afternoon tea time, especially rewarding after hours of shopping just downstairs.
