# MAISON REVKA SAINT-TROPEZ
## Maison Revka Saint-Tropez: A Summer Haven on Place des Lices
Building on the success of its Parisian sister venue, Maison Revka unveils its second venue on the famous Place des Lices in Saint-Tropez. Inspired by its prime location in the popular coastal town on the French Riviera, Maison Revka offers a summer ambiance perfect for leisurely lunches and enchanting dinners. The charming garden, adorned with roses, and jasmine and designed by architect Corinne Sachot, has quickly become a go-to spot for a refreshing green retreat.
