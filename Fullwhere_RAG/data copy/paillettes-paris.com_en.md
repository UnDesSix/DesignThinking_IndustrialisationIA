Restaurant with mediterraneans Influences
## Charcoal Cooking
This ancestral cooking technique is Paillettes Restaurant's little secret. Cooked using charcoal at over 300 degrees, meat, fish and vegetables are seared so they are caramelised on the outside and tender on the inside. The smoky flavour brought out by charcoal cooking without fat is very characteristic. Want to indulge in the gourmet joy of real Mediterranean cuisine?
