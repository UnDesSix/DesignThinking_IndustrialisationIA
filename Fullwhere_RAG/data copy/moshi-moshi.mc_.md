# Moshi Moshi is a Japanese Sushi Bar, created by Riccardo Giraudi in Monaco.
Small, intimate & warm, Moshi Moshi is a one of a kind sushi bar finding its inspirations into Japanese culture and Mediterranean traditional recipes.
Of course, the menu features the good classics such as freshly steamed edamame, miso soup, sashimi, maki, nigiri, ramen and so on. But the star of the show is the list of signature Moshi Moshi rolls in tribute to the gorgeous Mediterranean area.
Imagine yellow tail tartare paired with purple shiso sauce, King Crab mixed with yuzu cream or tuna ventresca in a Niçoise Salad inspired roll. For mains, the seabass is served with a Mediterranean tapenade, the Black Cod is marinated in miso & Pastis and the Milanese is Tonkatsu-style.
Open for lunch & dinner, Moshi Moshi is a little gem on the port de Fontvieille.
