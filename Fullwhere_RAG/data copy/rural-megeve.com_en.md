## CHEF **MARC VEYRAT**
The unavoidable chef with the big hat puts down his knives in Megève, for the immense pleasure of Savoyard gastronomes.
Is there a chef more attached to his native land than the iconic Marc Veyrat? Born in Annecy, the region and its products are dear to his heart and have always inspired his cooking.
## **A FRIENDLY MEETING PLACE AT RURAL**
Every day, lunch and dinner are served around large convivial tables, with a cuisine infused with local flavours. 
For a comforting break, guests can enjoy roblochon cheese, free-range chicken with old-fashioned cream and onion gratin, and mixed platters to share... a great way to warm up at Rural.
OUR MENU
## A TABLE
> "I wish to bring to light the excellent products of my region, and to magnify them. I serve a cuisine with Haute-Savoie identity, in a more refined way.
> At Rural, I prepare my potée with truffle emulsion, the white Tome of the day with black juice, our fish from the mountain lakes, the truffle fondue, or the tartiflette with my cousin's reblochon.
- Marc Veyrat
