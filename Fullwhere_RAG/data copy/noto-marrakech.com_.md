Au Noto: the cuisine of a chef who loves his country.
Emilio Giagnoni discovered his vocation at an early age, a vocation passed on by his grandmother, who was also passionate about cooking. A gastronomy of sharing, generous and joyful, is at the heart of Emilio’s signature. When he evokes pasta, or Sardinian specialties (his native region), it’s a whole universe you push open the door to. We melt at the passion and energy of the young chef when he talks about the know-how and sublime products he likes to work with every day at Noto.
