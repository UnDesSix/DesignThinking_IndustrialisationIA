**Culinary Signature**
## Julien Sebbag
Just three years after his talent was first brought to light (in 2018), Julien Sebbag has already taken the helm of four successful Parisian restaurants: Chez Oim (at the Bus Palladium), Créatures and Tortuga (on the rooftop terrace of Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann) and the brand new Forest (at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris).
Talented, sensitive and passionate, this young chef is as amazing as he is intriguing. The rising star in a new generation of committed chefs, Julien Sebbag designs his cuisine and his restaurants with a strong sense of eco-responsibility – from short circuits to seasonal and local products to zero waste and the well-being of his teams.
