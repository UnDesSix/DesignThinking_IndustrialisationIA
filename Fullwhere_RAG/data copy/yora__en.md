« Honestly, it’s super good, I’m Peruvian and I was not disappointed. I recommend the burgers and the empanadas which are incredible. »
Mickaela
« A great discovery of this new place in the neighborhood. I had a chicken Bowl that I composed, and a chicken empanada. Really very good! And very generous! The price is a bit high, but the ingredients are fresh and good! Served by two very smiling young ladies. I will come back :) »
Loan
« I discovered this new restaurant in the neighborhood, I had a burger that was super good and worth the price with their homemade tortillas, so I tried the bowls the next day with my colleagues, flawless. Also, the sauces are very elaborate and everything is especially fresh!!! I recommend this new concept. »
Bertrand
« Passing by chance and appreciating Peruvian cuisine, I had to try it. I tried the bowl and I sincerely found that they managed to dust off the concept which is now seen and reviewed. The Peru-style bowl is validated. The flavors offered blend perfectly. »
Raphael
« As a Peruvian, I can say that my burger was very good. It’s not a traditional restaurant with typical Peruvian dishes, sure. But there are Poke bowls and burgers inspired by the ingredients of Peru and obviously the culinary know-how. I really liked to see that you also offer Nikkei cuisine (Peruvian-Japanese fusion), good luck and good fortune 🍀 »
Marco
« Excellent! The dishes have the real traditional taste of Peruvian cuisine with a neat and generous presentation. Absolutely to try: the classic ceviche and the Lomo Saltado, a killer!! »
Rocio
« A great discovery! A place that makes you travel as much by taste as by the atmosphere. The dishes offered were rich in flavors, and the service was really top-notch. We will come back! »
Hélène
« Ideal setting, top service but above all absolutely delicious food. One of the best restaurants I have tried this year. I recommend it 100% and will return with my eyes closed. »
