## Gigi Rigolatto Paris: Iconic Italian Dining Alla Grande!
Each and every one of Gigi’s homes is special, but the one where it all started holds a special place in everyone’s hearts. Overlooking the City of Lights’ renowned Champs-Elysées and Eiffel Tower, dining at Gigi Paris is pretty much as iconic as it gets. The restaurant, specifically designed to capture the essence of Italian generosity, is meant to translate Gigi’s eclectic style above anything else – profoundly welcoming in all its grand sophistication.

## Urban Italian Classics à la Gigi 
When we say Gigi loves to spoil his guests, we really mean it. True to form, Gigi Paris has the most elaborate menu of all the Gigi homes, with lots of seasonal options and a profoundly urban flair. Between Gigi’s signature Tomatoes de la Nonna, Vitello Tonnato, and Milanese Veal Chop, the biggest challenge is to choose. Just make sure you don’t pass up on the Dover Sole Alla Puttanesca and crowd pleasing after-dinner treats such as the Gigi Bueno with Gianduja Chocolate.

## THE BELLINI BAR
Every exceptional establishment boasts a legendary bar, and Gigi is no exception with its legendary Bellini Bar. It serves as the ideal gathering place for aperitivo enthusiasts, where the eponymous cocktail can be savored in its classic prosecco form or creatively reinvented with new flavors, accompanied by a selection of beverages inspired by the rich Italian heritage, ranging from Negroni to Americano, and everything in between.

## GIGI'S LIVE MUSIC
Entering Gigi’s world is like syncing with the continuously evolving rhythm of a reinvented Dolce Vita. The exclusively curated Italian playlist, available until the second evening service, seamlessly weaves together elements of jazz, iconic songs from the 1950s and 1960s, and beloved Italian classics. It briefly steps aside to introduce live performances, leading to a gradual crescendo, immersing all guests in the renowned Gigi ambiance of electric vibrancy. 
Live music Thursday to Saturday | DJ Tuesday to Saturday
