Belle Plage Facial Care
This is the refined, tailor-made, and highly effective version of the Augustinus Bader method, combining the unique TFC8® complex with personalised facial massage to stimulate cell regeneration and Icoone technology to reshape the contours of the face. First of all, the skin is double-cleansed to promote the absorption of active ingredients that boost the skin's natural repair process. The signature facial massage then improves circulation and hydration, and prepares the face for the application of the ultra-smoothing detoxifying vegan mask for an oxygenating effect and an immediate boost of radiance. At the same time, the patient is given a head massage, activating the precious Augustinus Bader hair oil.
