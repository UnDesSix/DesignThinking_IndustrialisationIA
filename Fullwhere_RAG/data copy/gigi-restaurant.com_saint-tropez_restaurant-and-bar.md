## Gigi Rigolatto Saint-Tropez: a New Kind of Dining
When Gigi Ramatuelle was created, all the core values of the Italian spirit were taken to heart. As Gigi’s first quintessentially summery outpost, celebrating abundance is at the core of the Saint-Tropez restaurant. With a backdrop that beckons profound relaxation, nature is one of Gigi Saint-Tropez’s most valued allies – the leafy greens, warm light, and chirping birds blend in perfectly with the natural aesthetics of the restaurant and bar, inviting nothing but sweet laughter and good times all Summer long.

## Italian Culinary Delights in the French Riviera
Gigi’s crafted Ramatuelle menu is meant to be enjoyed al fresco, together with your favorite people. Classics such as the Truffled Arancini, King Crab Caesar Salad, and Spiny Lobster Spaghetti are served family-style and generously, or should we say Alla Grande! Of course, no summer night is complete without something sweet & sunny, so why not try Gigi’s Red Berries Pavlova to end the night on a high note.

## THE BELLINI BAR
The Bellini Bar at Gigi Rigolatto Saint-Tropez is your go-to destination for enjoying a wide range of cocktails, whether you prefer a daytime aperitif or an evening pick-me-up. Explore an array of Gigi’s favorite cocktails, such as Il Bellini di Gigi or the zesty Limone, both offering unique and refreshing flavors. Alternatively, savor classic Italian beverages like the ever-popular Negroni or the iconic Spritz.
Adults only | Open from 11:30am to 7pm
## DINNER UNDER THE STARS
Making the most of lingering Summer nights, Gigi Rigolatto Ramatuelle offers its guests the opportunity to extend the Alla Grande experience in an enchanting setting. As the sun sets against the sea, and with lush surroundings, we welcome you every evening for our signature dinner under the stars. While you relish our most refined Italian specialties, our talented live musicians add an extra layer of charm, weaving their musical magic to elevate your dining experience.
