City of London • Tue Oct, 2024
# Brad Kenny
COYA City is excited to present the dynamic work of Brad Kenny, whose powerful and expressive paintings will be showcased from October to January. 
Brad Kenny’s art is instantly recognisable by its bold brushstrokes, vibrant movement, and richly saturated colours. His innovative approach to painting transforms each piece into a visual language that speaks beyond words. Kenny’s distinctive style explores the depths of human experience, emotion, and identity, using abstraction and distortion to convey messages that resonate on a deeply personal level. 
Curated and exhibited by Alinda Kring Art Advisory.
