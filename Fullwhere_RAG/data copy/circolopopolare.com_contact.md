You can book a table right here. A confirmation e-mail will be sent, so be sure to check your spam - you never know! If you don't manage to book as we're full, don't panic! We always keep a few tables for our cool clienti who drop in unannounced! We still advise you to come early, around 20 minutes before opening time, so you aren't kept waiting. When you arrive, our host team will seat you at the first available table or put you on the waiting list. For your information, we open reservations 21 days in advance.
