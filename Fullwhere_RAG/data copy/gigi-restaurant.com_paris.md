## Gigi Paris: Milanese Charm on Avenue Montaigne
Gigi Rigolatto isn’t just a restaurant – it’s about embracing a lifestyle, a Milanese one at that. Nestled in the exclusive Golden Triangle, with the Eiffel Tower in sight and the Théâtre des Champs Elysées downstairs, Gigi brings a slice of Italy to one of Paris’ most elite neighborhoods as its first ever home. Authentic Italian flavors curated from the finest produce, as well as the most tantalizing aperitivos await you in Gigi’s elegant abode. And with Gigi’s knack for setting the mood with lively entertainment in the evening, expect every evening to be an eventful affair.

## Italian Delicacies Meet Parisian Elegance 
Begin your journey at Gigi Rigolatto Paris at the Bellini Bar, setting the tone for an evening filled with Italian generosity. As you savor the likes of crispy Arancini and hearty Ossobuco, the restaurant’s ambiance, designed by Gigi’s favorite architect Hugo Toro, envelopes you. With design elements reminiscent of a Venetian palace – majestic columns, golden Sienna marble, and Roman travertine, Gigi Paris is a sensory treat.
