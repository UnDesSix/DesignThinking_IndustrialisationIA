## IMMEDIATE BOARDING FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY
Les Cafés & Comptoirs Lapérouse are a tribute to the art of entertaining, to French savoir-faire and to destinations outside the walls of the flagship Quai des Grand Augustins.
At any time of the day, from breakfast to dinner, Cafés Lapérouse are the perfect meeting place in a charming decor, inspired by the voyages of the explorer from whom the restaurant takes its name. Cordelia de Castellane, the Artistic Director combines influences of the 18th century, colorful prints and Art Deco touches to give life to an irresistible mix of genres.
On the menu, at all hours, an ode to subtle and tasty French cuisine, to celebrate all occasions, day or night.
