In the southeast of Sicily, in the town of Noto, Barbarian lions still dominate the baroque facades of balconies: the emblem of the restaurant was found.

Noto by
## Laura Gonzalez
Once again with Moma Group, alongside Benjamin Patou, Laura has crafted a joyful blend of inspirations through her travels around Sicily, offering a highly distinct result brimming with references to the history of Sicily’s syncretic culture.
After conquering Parisian nightlife through transformations of the capital’s mythical establishments like Bus Palladium, she has left her mark upon many restaurants – including Noto Paris.

## The timeless elegance of Italy
Welcome to the south of Italy, and more precisely, to the charming little town of Noto, a baroque and sensual Sicilian village whose poetic beauty can be felt in its rich palaces and sleepy squares. Orchards brimming with lemon, olive and almond trees surround this picturesque haven of Italian elegance; look a bit further still and you’ll find the pistachio trees of Bronte on the foothills of Mount Etna and the wild capers of the small island of Pantelleria. Let’s not forget the multi-faceted roots of the Sicilian table: the fusion of Greek, Latin and Arabic culinary cultures.

## NOTO by night
Noto is also a place to party, Italian style. One of Paris’ most vibrant restaurants, Noto comes alive nightly to the beat of live singers and musicians. Enjoy the perfect burrata and delicious Italian wines with friends… but most of all, party! Starting at 10pm, the music lineup shifts to French variety tunes, promising to get everyone on the same page – and onto the dance floor.
