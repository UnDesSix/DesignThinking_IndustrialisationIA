### 12. Your Rights
NOCTIS EVENT is particularly concerned about respecting the rights granted to you in the context of the data processing that it implements, in order to guarantee fair and transparent processing, taking into account the particular circumstances and context in which your personal data is processed.
#### 12.1 Your right of access
Under this heading, you have confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed and where it is, you have the right to request a copy of your data and information concerning:
– the purposes of the processing ;
– the categories of personal data concerned;
– the recipients or categories of recipients as well as, if applicable, if such communication is to be made, the international organizations to which the personal data has been or will be communicated, in particular the recipients who are established in third countries;
– where possible, the period for which the personal data will be kept or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period;
– the existence of the right to ask the data controller to rectify or erase your personal data, the right to request a limitation of the processing of your personal data, the right to object to such processing;
– the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
– information about the source of the data when it is not collected directly from the data subjects;
– the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and in the latter case, relevant information about the underlying logic and the significance and intended consequences of such processing for the data subjects.
#### 12.2 Your right to rectify your data
You can ask us to rectify or complete your personal data if it is inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous or out of date.
#### 12.3 Your right to erasure of your data
You can ask us to delete your personal data in the cases provided for by the legislation and regulations.
Please note that the right to the deletion of data is not a general right and can only be exercised if one of the reasons provided for in the applicable regulations is present.
#### 12.4 Your right to limit data processing
You may request the limitation of the processing of your personal data in the cases provided for by the legislation and regulations.
#### 12.5 Your right to object to data processing
You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data where the legal basis is the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller (see article above on the legal basis for processing).
If you exercise such a right to object, we will ensure that we no longer process your personal data in connection with the processing concerned unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for continuing such processing. These grounds will have to outweigh your interests and rights and freedoms, or the processing will be justified for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. You have the right to object to personalized solicitation.
#### 12.6 Your right to the portability of your data
You have the right to the portability of your personal data. Please note that this is not a general right. Indeed, not all data from all processing operations are portable and this right only concerns automated processing operations to the exclusion of manual or paper processing operations.
This right is limited to processing whose legal basis is your consent or the execution of pre-contractual measures or a contract.
This right does not include derived or inferred data, which are personal data created by NOCTIS EVENT.
#### 12.7 Your right to withdraw consent
Where our data processing is based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. We will then stop processing your personal data without affecting the previous operations to which you have consented.
#### 12.8 Your right to appeal
You have the right to lodge a complaint to the GDPR supervisory authority of the country in which you are located, without prejudice to any other administrative or legal recourse.
On French territory, the authority is CNIL (3 place de Fontenoy 75007 Paris).
#### 12.9 Your Right to Set Post-Mortem Instructions
You have the right to set up specific instructions regarding the retention, deletion and disclosure of your personal data after your death in the manner set out below. These special instructions will only apply to the processing carried out by us and will be limited to that scope.
You will also have, when this person will have been designated by the executive power, to define general directives for the same purposes.
#### 12.10 How to exercise your rights
All the rights listed above can be exercised at the following e-mail address **donnees.privees@paris-society.com** or by mail by addressing to NOCTIS EVENT 38 avenue des Champs-Elysées 75008 PARIS FRANCE, by proving your identity by any means.
