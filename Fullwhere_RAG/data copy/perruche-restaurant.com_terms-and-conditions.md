### 8. FORCE MAJEURE AND RELOCATION

  * If a Force Majeure Event lasts more than thirty (30) days after its occurrence, these Terms may be terminated by any of the Parties without any of them being able to claim damages. In the case of a Force Majeure Event, an exceptional event or impossibility to carry out the Service and, in particular, making the room of the Establishment available to the Customer, the Establishment may reserve the option of providing accommodation to the Customer, in whole or in part, at an Establishment in the equivalent category or perform a Service of the same nature, subject to the prior agreement of the Customer.

### 9. CONTACT, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMPLAINTS
  * Customer Service is at your disposal to address any claim relating to a Service on the Site.


You can reach us at louise.brandexperience@paris-society.com
Or you may write to us at: each Establishment’s contact address to facilitate the processing of complaints, it is advisable to send the complaints in writing to the Customer Service Department concerning the non-performance or poor performance of the Services within eight (8) days after the date of completion of the Service.
  * In its relations with the customer service department, the Customer undertakes to remain courteous and not to make any derogatory comments, in particular with regard to Paris Society , the Establishments, the entities of its group or its employees or collaborators, in accordance with the rules of common sense and politeness. Paris Society reserves the right to take all appropriate measures against the Customer in the event of prejudicial or reprehensible behaviour (in particular unfortunate, malicious or insulting behaviour) with regard to Paris Society, the Establishments, entities of its group or its employees or collaborators.


### 10. PRIVACY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION
  * When the Customer uses the Site, in particular when making a reservation, Paris Society and Paris Society group entities process personal data as described in the “Paris Society Group Privacy Policy”.
  * Thus, the information collected as part of the Customer’s reservation is intended for Paris Society, its entities, its partners, its service providers (in particular online payment service providers) and the Establishments for the purpose of executing the reservation. Once the guarantees provided for by the applicable regulations have been put in place, the Customer’s data may be transferred from Europe to countries that do not ensure, from the point of view of France and the European Union, an equivalent level of data protection.
  * In particular, in order to secure payment transactions, Paris Society group entities process personal data to determine the level of fraud risk associated with each transaction. On this occasion, Paris Society and the Establishments may use the Paris Society group risk prevention service provider to refine their analysis. Depending on the results of the investigations carried out, Paris Society group may take security measures, in particular requesting the Customer to use a different reservation channel or an alternative payment method. These measures will have the effect of suspending the execution of the reservation or, if the result of the analysis does not guarantee the safety of the order, of cancelling it. Fraudulent use of a means of payment leading to payment default may result in the Customer being entered in the Paris Society group incident file, which may lead Paris Society group to block future payments or carry out additional checks.
  * The Customer may at any time exercise his rights under the regulations on the protection of personal data. All the information required for this purpose is set out in the “Paris Society Group Privacy Policy”.


### 11. MISCELLANEOUS
  * The input of the required bank information and the acceptance of these Terms and the Special Terms and Conditions by electronic means constitute an electronic contract between the Parties which is proof between the Parties of the reservation of the Service and the payment of the sums due upon the execution of said reservation.
  * The Terms and the applicable Special Conditions constitute the entirety of the obligations of the Parties. No other condition communicated by the Customer may be incorporated herein.
  * In the event of a contradiction between the Special Conditions and the Terms, the Special Conditions will be the only ones applicable for the obligation concerned. In case of contradiction between, on the one hand, the general terms and conditions, of whatever nature, of a Partner and these Terms, on the other, the stipulations of these Terms will be the only ones applicable to the obligation at issue.
  * If one or more stipulations of these Terms are deemed to be invalid or declared as such under a law, regulation or following a decision adjudicated by a competent jurisdiction that has become final, any other stipulations shall remain in force to their full extent.
  * The authentic language is English. If the Terms are translated into a foreign language, the English language will prevail over any other translation in the event of any dispute, litigation, difficulty of interpretation or in the fulfilment of these conditions and, in a more general manner, regarding the relations between the Parties.
  * The Customer acknowledges and agrees that Paris Society may assign these Terms and all of the rights and obligations attached thereto to any third party without the prior written consent of the Customer. The Customer agrees that such assignment releases Paris Society for future deeds. The Customer may not assign the Terms, nor the rights and obligations attached thereto to third parties without the prior written consent of Paris Society.


### 12. APPLICABLE LAW
These Terms and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of French.
The choice of governing law shall not restrict you of any protections you are granted by law in the country you are from.
### 13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Any claim or dispute arising from the validity, interpretation or performance of the Terms shall be subject to the competent courts in the jurisdiction of the Paris Court of Appeal, under the conditions of ordinary law.
