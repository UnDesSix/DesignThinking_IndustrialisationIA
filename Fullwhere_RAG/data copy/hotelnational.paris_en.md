# In the heart of the Marais, discover a timeless art of living that seamlessly blends elegance and authenticity.
A one-of-a-kind hotel in Paris reveals itself with elegance and discretion behind Haussmannian façades. Combining bold architectural design with a deep commitment to environmental sustainability, this establishment features 64 rooms where the raw beauty of noble materials – stone, terrazzo, steel, solid wood – is showcased with sophistication, crafted by the expert hands of master artisans.
**RISTORANTE NATIONAL**
From Rue Réaumur to the hotel's bright patio, Ristorante National embodies the elegance of a chic trattoria. Driven by a passionate team, this destination celebrates the authenticity of Italian cuisine, elevating carefully selected ingredients to perfection.

**A MIXOLOGICAL DEN**
The talented Oscar Quagliarini has created a cocktail menu like a perfumer composing his fragrances. Each cocktail has a strong olfactory/gustatory identity, sometimes feminine and sometimes masculine, which should awaken all the taster's senses.
**THE CITY FOR DECORATION**
On the hotel's roof, a terrace offers a unique view of the rooftops of Paris, which is also shared by the Penthouse, the hotel's centrepiece. Suddenly, Sacré-Coeur, the Centre Pompidou or Les Arts & Métiers voisins appeared from a new angle. Open to all and without reservation. 
DISCOVER OUR ROOFTOP
**ARCHITECTURAL SIGNATURE**
Designer **Raphael Navot** creates a subtle dialogue here between the timeless elegance of the Haussmannian style, emblematic of Paris, and the modernity of a hotel concept firmly rooted in the 21st century.
Materials and textures, meticulously crafted with deep respect for artisanal traditions, are reimagined through bold forms and designs, transcending trends and standing the test of time.
